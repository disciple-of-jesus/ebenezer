This repository's existence is based upon [this Bible verse](https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-12.htm):

> Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the LORD
> has helped us.”

It's a (continuous) remembrance that it is God and God alone who helps me and is the One who deserves all the glory and
honor.
